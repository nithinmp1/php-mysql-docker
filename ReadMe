Include
  Docker Quickstart Terminal 
  php 7.3
  mysql 8.0

to access database 

docker exec -it mysql-server-80  bash -l
mysql -u db_user -p.mypwd
 

Windows is that the references to localhost or 0.0.0.0 didn't work at all when I tried to access the application in the browser. It's using Docker Quickstart Terminal which runs a Linux image on Windows and it runs Docker inside that
